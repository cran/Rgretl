Description: An interface to 'GNU gretl': running 'gretl' scripts from, estimating econometric
             models with backward passing of model results, opening 'gretl' data files (.gdt).
             'gretl' can be downloaded from <http://gretl.sourceforge.net>. This package could make
             life on introductory/intermediate econometrics courses much easier:   full battery of the
             required regression diagnostics,   including White's heteroskedasticity test, restricted ols
             estimation,   advanced weak instrument test after iv estimation, very convenient dealing
             with lagged variables in models,   standard case treatment in unit root tests,   vector auto-
             regressions, and vector error correction  models.   Datasets for   8 popular econometrics 
             textbooks can be installed into 'gretl' from its server. All datasets can be easily imported
             using this package.
